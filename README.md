## Day Job

I'm the Senior Manager of Technical Support at Progress Software, responsible for the Americas' support teams covering DevTools and Sitefinty. My team and I provide technical help for developers using Sitefinity, Telerik & Kendo UI DevTools, Test Studio, Fiddler, and more. Check out some of our demos at [https://www.telerik.com/support/demos](https://www.telerik.com/support/demos).

I love writing code and watching it come alive. My passion is mostly UI, but also all the things that powers the UI... from backend APIs to AI-powered fun. For one fun example, check out [Flusher](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/Flusher), the complete system that flushes the toilet for my cat [using IoT, SignalR, Azure Custom Vision AI and a mobile+web app to Flush a Toilet](https://dvlup.com/2020/02/13/using-windows-iot-signalr-azure-custom-vision-and-xamarin-forms-to-flush-a-toilet/).

There are too many hobbies and passions to mention, but as of late I've been having a ton of fun with homelab, networking, and self-hosting. I've been running Home Assistant for many years, my houses are all hooked up with UniFi gear, with site-to-site VPNs up to Azure so I can safely self-host host my fav apps like Portainer, Home Assistant, Immich, etc.
