## Day Job

I am the Senior Manager of Technical Support at Progress Software. I am responsible for DevTools and Sitefinty for the Americas. My team and I provide technical help for developers using Sitefinity, Telerik & Kendo UI DevTools, Test Studio, Fiddler, and more. Check out some of our demos at [https://www.telerik.com/support/demos](https://www.telerik.com/support/demos).

I love writing code and watching it come alive in the user's hands. My passion is mostly UI, but also all the things that powers the UI... from backend APIs to AI-powered fun. For one example, check out [Flusher](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/Flusher), the complete system that flushes the toilet for my cat [using IoT, SignalR, Azure Custom Vision AI and a mobile+web app to Flush a Toilet](https://dvlup.com/2020/02/13/using-windows-iot-signalr-azure-custom-vision-and-xamarin-forms-to-flush-a-toilet/).

There are too many hobbies and passions to mention, but as of late I've been having a ton of fun with homelab, networking, and self-hosting. I've been running Home Assistant for many years, my houses are all hooked up with UniFi gear, with site-to-site VPNs up to Azure so I can safely self-host host my fav apps like Portainer, Home Assistant, Immich, etc.
